<p>On my third day in Saigon, I decided to rent a motorbike for the next couple of weeks.</p>

I was a little hesitant at first. I&rsquo;ve heard war stories of people who were injured while motorbiking around Southeast Asia. In fact my buddy, Ryan, was in a pretty nasty accident while vacationing through Thailand and had to cut the trip short. Combine unfamiliarity with the roads and the lack of any logical rules, and you increase the likelihood of getting into an accident. Looking forward, going at your own comfortable pace, and understanding that honks inform you another biker&rsquo;s presence can get you pretty far safely. Also, as Don poignantly pointed out, don&rsquo;t fuck with buses.
</span></p>

<p>Don directed me to a place off of Nguyen Thi Minh Khai. Like most Vietnamese businesses, the rental shop was also the home and residence of the owners. Typically when renting out to foreigners, shops will demand your passport as a kind of security deposit. Since I&rsquo;m not comfortable giving up my passport for a couple weeks, I opted to give the guy $300 in cash instead.</p>

<p>The experience has been good so far. I&rsquo;ve been pretty careful about following the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; to avoid getting pulled over by the cops. Apparently, in the event of a police encounter, you can usually avoid getting your bike towed if you pay the cops off for about 200,000VND. Hopefully this doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a video of me motorbiking the streets at night. There&rsquo;s something immensely satisfying about feeling the cool night&rsquo;s breeze blowing in my face.</p>

<p>After 15 hours of flying, with a layover at Incheon, I finally made it to Saigon safe and sound at around 10:40pm. The ensuing 24 hours was eventful to say the least.</p>

<p>My uncle, Bob (Cáº­u Bao in Vietnamese), met me at the airport and we grabbed a cab. The feeling was surreal and dreamlike. I have been thinking about this trip for the last two and a half months. So as we were exiting the airport, I rolled down the window and breathed it all in: dim street lights illuminating unmarked lanes; motorbikes zipping by and honking in passing; the low level chatter and laughter of locals drinking beer on the sidewalk in the background. To say I was excited is an understatement. I was ecstatic and enthralled to be living my dream.</p>

<p>However, first order of business: pho. Of course. Unfortunately I was too delirious and brain dead to take a picture of the meal. It was awesome though. I&rsquo;ll have to come back there again to snag a picture with the location. I&rsquo;m still new to this blogging thing and consequently will have to be more diligent about taking pictures and writing down the places I visit.</p>

<p>Since I refused to sleep on the five hour flight from Seoul to Saigon, I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to explore.</p>

<div class="left-align left-thumbnail"><iframe src="http://mattnguyen.github.io//instagram.com/p/kldcEblig3/embed/" width="250" height="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></div>


<p></p>

<p>I took a taxi to my uncle&rsquo;s office in district 1, the downtown area of Saigon. Since my iPhone unlock didn&rsquo;t go through on time, I got an international Nokia phone for about $25 and a sim card for $10. This will be useful when I travel to Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. I spent the rest of the day walking around Ben Thanh Market and the backpacker&rsquo;s area with no real purpose or agenda.</p>

<p>While navigating around the street venders hustling sunglasses, fruit, and lottery tickets, I came up on a nice little place serving bun thit nuong cha gio, which is grilled pork over vermicelli with egg roll served on top of a heaping pile of fresh lettuce and herbs. And the price? <strong>A whopping $2</strong>. I&rsquo;m in heaven!</p>

<div class="left-align"><iframe src="http://mattnguyen.github.io//instagram.com/p/kn_S1olip9/embed/" width="390" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></div>




<div class="right-align"><iframe src="http://mattnguyen.github.io//instagram.com/p/kn-8rYFipd/embed/" width="390" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></div>


<p>When nighttime arrived, I met up with an old friend, Don Ho, for drinks at some restaurant in downtown. He was accompanied by a friend who just moved from Cambodia to Vietnam. Both of these guys work at venture capital firms, and so we basically talked startups, institional money in Vietnam, and bitcoin for the next couple rounds of brews.</p>

<p>At around 10:30pm, we left the restaurant and headed out to <a href="http://www.lush.vn">Lush</a>, a pretty cool electronic and hip hop dance club with two dancing areas and a garden patio. Tuesday night is ladies night, so admission and drinks are free until midnight for&hellip;wait for it&hellip;ladies. When we arrived, the main dance area was so packed, we had to move to the smaller dancing area where the DJ played hip hop for the night. I&rsquo;m pretty sure people were weirded out by my Bay Area dancing, but whatever. I had a blast :).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems like only yesterday when I moved from Austin back to San Francisco for Dev Bootcamp. So much has changed since.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Brief update</h3>

<p>After ten grueling weeks of nonstop, intensive learning, I managed to get hired as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.tapjoy.com">Tapjoy</a>. For the last year and a half, I was able to work on a plethora of interesting projects including Tapjoy.com, video and MRAID ad products, and eventually building out and shipping the Events Framework and publisher messages. My teammates have all inspired me in different ways, and I&rsquo;m grateful for all that I&rsquo;ve learned in the short time I&rsquo;ve been with them.</p>

<p>Alas, it is time for me to move on. Not to another company or a different professsion. Rather, I&rsquo;ll be doing some serious traveling around Southeast Asia for the next five months.</p>

<h3>Why quit your job then?</h3>

<p>Mainly because I wanted to get away for awhile. No responsibilities. No rent. No pressure. Just the freedom, craziness, and anxiety that comes with backpacking for an extended period of time. It&rsquo;s going to be awesome.</p>

<h3>What are your travel plans?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure. I&rsquo;ll be flying into Saigon, and I will be in Vietnam for a little less than a month. After that I&rsquo;ll be hopping on a plane to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for <a href="http://www.futuremusicfestival.asia/2014/">Future Music Festival</a>. After FMF, I&rsquo;ll be working my way up Malaysia to Bangkok, Thailand, where I&rsquo;ll be meeting <a href="http://www.bsiddiqui.com">Basil</a> for Songkran and Full Moon Festival.</p>

<p>When Basil leaves, I&rsquo;ll work my way East to Cambodia, North through Laos, and then back into Vietnam where I&rsquo;ll head south down Vietnam&rsquo;s coast back to Saigon. I have no real plans for this portion of the trip, so it&rsquo;s a little bit unstructured at the moment. But that&rsquo;s what makes this so damn fun :).</p>

<h3>That&rsquo;s about it</h3>

<p>So this is where I&rsquo;m at in my life. I leave in a couple days. I&rsquo;m going to be a little bit more dilligent about blogging this time around. Heck, I even built out and customized my own octopress blog (more info on this in another post) for this purpose. If you want to find out what I&rsquo;m doing, feel free to check back here, follow my <a href="http://instagram.com/__mattn">instagram</a> (@__mattn), or follow my <a href="https://twitter.com/MrMattNguyen">twitter</a> (@mrmattnguyen) for updates.</p>

<p>I plan on following up with more detailed information about my Asia trip, including backpacking essentials, itineraries, must-see places, must-go-to parties, and anything you might want to know if you&rsquo;re considering doing something similar.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to 2014! Wish me luck!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://matt-nguyen.tumblr.com/post/22890572560/on-life-and-moving-forward">(This Tumblr post</a> has been reposted to provide some continuity for my new site and life journey.)</p>
<p>For my inaugural Tumblr post, I feel obligated to update those who are close to me on what I have been doing, what I will be doing, and why I created this <strike>Tumblr account</strike>.</p>
<p>(TL;DR - I&#8217;ve been living in Austin as a project manager for the last year; I&#8217;m moving back to the Bay to do Dev Bootcamp and will forgo law school; I&#8217;m documenting my journey to inspire those who are considering the same path)</p>
<!-- more -->
<p><strong>What I&#8217;ve been doing</strong></p>
<p>After graduating from Cal in winter 2010, I moved to Southern California to work for <a href="http://www.gettrx.com">Global Electronic Technology Inc.</a>, a merchant services company specializing in payment processing solutions, with my degree in rhetoric in one hand and a suitcase full of clothes in the other. The plan was simple: I would take the next year and a half to develop my professional skills while preparing for law school. The job would be a stepping stone on my journey towards lawyerhood and served two purposes: one, since the company was moving to Austin, TX, relocating would strategically position me in the middle of the country where I could easily mobilize myself in the event I were accepted to a prominent law school on either coasts; and two, I would delay the inevitable soul crushing proffered by three years of intense legal studies.</p>
<p>Almost a year has passed since moving to Austin, and I am fairly certain that attending law school now will be a bad choice for a plethora of reasons, many of which were derived from reading through&nbsp;<a href="http://top-law-schools.com/forums/index.php">this law school forum</a>&nbsp;( an&nbsp;amazing resource for prospective law students). Although GET has been a great company to work for, I yearned to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself with computer science and web development. I began reading free online resources and participated in online courses, such as <a href="http://www.coursera.com">Coursera</a>, <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com">Codeacademy</a>, and <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>. After reading several blogs about learning strategies for computer science, I came across <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>, a 10-week intensive Ruby on Rails program dedicated to turning individuals with no programming experience into &#8220;world class beginners.&#8221; I applied, interviewed with <a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxSF-Shereef-Bishay-Open-Ente">Shereef Bishay</a>, received my acceptance, and submitted my deposit not too long after discovering this wonderful program (future post on the DBC application process forthcoming).</p>
<p><strong>What I&#8217;m going to do</strong></p>
<p>I am pretty damn excited about this, and it&#8217;s hard not to be considering recent praise over <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/10/dev-boot-camp-is-a-ruby-success/">DBC&#8217;s first cohort&#8217;s employment results</a>. With 88% of the class receiving offers of $79k on average, becoming a web developer makes more economic and financial sense than attending law school, where <a href="http://insidethelawschoolscam.blogspot.com/2012/03/career-opportunities.html">recent graduates are struggling to find jobs</a>, are completely overwhelmed with <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/05/07/projected-law-school-debt-figures-revised-even-higher/">six figures of non-dischargeable debt</a>, and are seeking <a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2012/02/twelve-more-law-schools-slapped-with-class-action-lawsuits-over-employment-data/">legal recourse against schools</a> who misrepresent employment statistics. From June 11 to &nbsp;August 17, I will be sharing an office space with approximately 40 other motivated students who are just as eager to learn RoR and launch their new careers as web developers. Already, the level of collaboration is high with students attending meet-ups and hack nights together, and the program hasn&#8217;t even started! It will be interesting to see what we&#8217;ll be able to accomplish at the end of the 10 weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why I created this blog</strong></p>
<p>From being a prospective law student to becoming a web developer, I am compelled to document my story so that future generations of Booters can benefit from my experiences, and hopefully I can inspire people with non-technical backgrounds who are passionate about technology and motivated to switch careers to take the plunge and do something about it. I have not completely given up my aspiration for attending law school, but I have not found compelling reasons to do so right now. Perhaps when a future opportunity presents itself, I&#8217;ll attend law school for intellectual property law *cough*Stanford*cough*Boalt*&nbsp;since I&#8217;ll be in a much better position to do so as a web developer. In any case, I&#8217;m thrilled for this opportunity, and I absolutely cannot wait to see my friends, family, and meet my fellow Booters in the Bay.&nbsp;</p></p>
