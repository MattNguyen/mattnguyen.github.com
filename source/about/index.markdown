Yo! I’m Matt Nguyen. I’m currently working as a backend software engineer at Tapjoy, primarily doing Ruby on Rails development.

I spend a lot of my time learning new technologies. Lately, I’ve been messing around with Ansible, Node.js, and iOS development.

This blog doesn’t have a real purpose except to record my ramblings about life, technology, and whatever else pops into my mind. It also serves as a life updater to everyone who’s interested in what I’m doing.

Check out my friend’s blogs!
